# Core Flight System : Framework : App : Telemetry Output Lab

This repository contains NASA's Telemetry Output Lab (to_lab), which is a framework component of the Core Flight System.

This lab application is a non-flight utility to downlink telemetry from the cFS Bundle. It is intended to be located in the `apps/to_lab` subdirectory of a cFS Mission Tree. The Core Flight System is bundled at <https://github.com/nasa/cFS> (which includes to_lab as a submodule), which includes build and execution instructions.

to_lab is a simple telemetry downlink application that sends CCSDS telecommand packets over a UDP/IP port. The UDP port and IP address are specified in the "Enable Telemetry" command. It does not provide a full CCSDS Telecommand stack implementation.

To send telemtry to the "ground" or UDP/IP port, edit the subscription table in the platform include file: fsw/platform_inc/to_lab_sub_table.h. to_lab will subscribe to the packet IDs that are listed in this table and send the telemetry packets it receives to the UDP/IP port.

## Version History

### Development Build: v2.4.0-rc1+dev41

-  Use `cfe.h` header file
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/91>

### Development Build: v2.4.0-rc1+dev38

- Fix #85, Remove numeric pipe ID from event printf
- Fix #87, Add Testing Tools to the Security Policy
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/89>

### Development Build: 2.4.0-rc1+dev32

- Removes end-of-function comments in `to_lab_app.c`
- Adds static analysis and code format check to continuous integration workflow. Updates workflow status badges in ReadMe
- Adds CodeQL analysis to continuous integration workflow
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/84>

### Development Build: 2.4.0-rc1+dev21

- TO remains command-able after a "remove all subscriptions" command; the command now only removes all subscriptions to the Tlm_pipe
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/75>

### Development Build: 2.4.0-rc1+dev17

- Aligns messages according to changes in cFE <https://github.com/nasa/cFE/issues/1009>. Uses the "raw" message cmd/tlm types in definition
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/70>

### Development Build: 2.4.0-rc1+dev13

- Replaces deprecated SB API's with MSG
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/65>

### Development Build: 2.4.0-rc1+dev9

- Update the TLMsockid field to be `osal_id_t` instead of uint32
- Set revision number to 99 to indicate development status in telemetry
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/59>

### Development Build: 2.4.0-rc1+dev6

- Adds header guard to `to_lab_sub_table.h`
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/59>

### Development Build: 2.4.0-rc1+dev3

- Remove reference to deprecated `CFE_ES_SHELL_TLM_MID`.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/58>

### Development Build: 2.3.0+dev45

- Fixes bug where an unset address values caused subscriptions to MsgId 0 over 200 times. Added a `TO_UNUSED` entry at the end of the subscription list and a break in the subscription loop when `TO_UNUSED` found. No more subscriptions on the unused table slots (no MsgId 0 subscriptions).
- Corrects return value of `TO_LAB_init()` to be `int32` instead of `int`. Declaration now matches definition, and app builds without errors.
- Add build number and baseline to version reporting.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/53>

### Development Build: 2.3.7

- Makes the `TO_LAB_Subs` table into a CFE_TBL-managed table.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/46>


### Development Build: 2.3.6

- Replace references to `ccsds.h` types with the `cfe_sb.h`-provided type.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/44>

### Development Build: 2.3.5

- Apply code style
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/43>

### Development Build: 2.3.4

- Configure the maximum depth supported by OSAL, rather than a hard coded 64.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/39>

### Development Build: 2.3.3

- Apply the CFE_SB_MsgIdToValue() and CFE_SB_ValueToMsgId() routines where compatibility with an integer MsgId is necessary - syslog prints, events, compile-time MID #define values.
- Deprecates shell tlm subscription
- Changes to documentation
- See <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/38>

### Development Build: 2.3.2

- Use OSAL socket API instead of BSD Sockets

- Use global namespace to isolate variables

- Minor updates (see <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/27>)

### Development Build: 2.3.1

- Fix for a clean build with OMIT_DEPRECATED
- Minor updates (see <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/26>)

### _**OFFICIAL RELEASE: 2.3.0 - Aquila**_

- Minor updates (see <https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/pull/13>)

- Not backwards compatible with OSAL 4.2.1

- Released as part of cFE 6.7.0, Apache 2.0

### _**OFFICIAL RELEASE: 2.2.0a**_

- Released as part of cFE 6.6.0a, Apache 2.0

## Known issues
