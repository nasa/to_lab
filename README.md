# Core Flight System : Framework : App : Telemetry Output Lab

This repository contains NASA's Telemetry Output Lab (to_lab), which is a framework component of the Core Flight System.

This lab application is a non-flight utility to downlink telemetry from the cFS Bundle. It is intended to be located in the `apps/to_lab` subdirectory of a cFS Mission Tree.  The Core Flight System is bundled at https://github.com/nasa/cFS (which includes to_lab as a submodule), which includes build and execution instructions.

to_lab is a simple telemetry downlink application that sends CCSDS telecommand packets over a UDP/IP port. The UDP port and IP address are specified in the "Enable Telemetry" command.  It does not provide a full CCSDS Telecommand stack implementation.

To send telemtry to the "ground" or UDP/IP port, edit the subscription table in the platform include file: build/<cpuX>/inc/to_lab_sub_table.h.  to_lab will subscribe to the packet IDs that are listed in this table and send the telemetry packets it receives to the UDP/IP port.

## Release Notes

to_lab version 2.2.0a is released as part of cFE 6.6.0a under the Apache 2.0 license, see [LICENSE](LICENSE-18128-Apache-2_0.pdf).

Note the old GSFC Build toolset is deprecated (fsw/for_build/Makefile) in favor of cmake (CMakeLists.txt)

## Known issues

As a lab application, extensive testing is not performed prior to release and only minimal functionality is included.
